### Title: Detection of Missing Persons Using Mobile App
### Abstract
The number of missing persons cases in India are growing by the day. These problems tend to occur in public places such as railway stations, bus stops, and retail malls. It is very difficult and complicated to find a lost person in a huge and busy environment. The missing individual’s information is entered to the missing person database, which provides extensive information on missing people (eg: Name, Images, Contacts, Address etc). Finding a missing individual can be a challenging effort, but if you know where to search, it is frequently lot simpler. Simply follow a few easy steps to locate a missing individual in our application. Our application acts as interface between police and public to find out the missing people. Our application serves as a bridge between the police and the general public in the search for missing individuals. Our app offers a list of missing persons as well as their contact information. In our app, cops will enter information about missing people into a database. Both the general public and the police may find information on missing people by searching by name, age, gender, and complexion. We have call and share features in our app, which allow you to contact the missing person’s family and share the missing person’s information with others. If the missing individual is recovered, the police will remove the related person’s information from the database. So, by using our application, we can quickly and precisely detect the missing person.
